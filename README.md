# Bayesian Blocks
This R package extends Jeff Scargle's Bayesian Blocks, an algorithm for optimal piecewise segmentation of non-homogeneous Poisson process data. The extensions allow for block segmentations to have non-constant intensities. Depending on the assumptions of the dataset, block segmentations can be allowed to take on power and exponential function shapes.
